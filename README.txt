Hi, I'm Abid. An Independent Researcher & Content Writer.
I make sure your competitors never steal your thunder ;)


I have been working as a freelance content writer for more than five years. During this time, I have had the opportunity to work with several international companies. 
As a researcher, I have acquired extensive knowledge about popular practices in the content marketing area. 

On top of that, as a writer, my motto is to deliver high quality content that best benefits the client's business.
